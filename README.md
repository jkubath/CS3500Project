The main menu has a comment section that shows approved comments by the owner.  Users can alos submit comments/concerns from the main page.

The Menu displays items based on what is offered at that certain location.  The nutrition facts are also generated by what ingredients go into the items.

The Order page needs to have a logged in user to place an order.  The user is re-directed to the login page if they are not logged in.  The store location is selected and the offered items are displayed.  The user can then select which items they want to add to their order or save to their "Custom Burgers".  The items can be edited by removing or adding itmes.  Newly added toppings are added to the cost.

The Locations page is made by implementing the Google Maps API.  The locations are made through a php file that generates the XML file.  The XML file is read and displayed on the map.

  Employees can login and with a manger's approval can see the active orders.  They can also fulfill orders.
  Managers can edit which items are offered at the stores they manage.
